There is always something new being developed here at GriffinPlan. In this release, we have the following:
* Ability to add programs and link projects to them, along with adding vendors and linking people to them (for contractors or temporary help)
* Additional reporting features to group by program and vendor
* Features to transition reporting periods from being in the future to being forecasted to having actuals available to finally being archived as prior periods.

Coming up in the next release, we are working on budgets and linking them to forecasts and actuals for your tracking.
